# Community-Service-App

### Application specifications
Build an application that will help establish connections between people in a community/city. Only authenticated users will be able to post to the system. The idea is to allow users within the same city to communicate, ask for services, and allow volunteers to provide the service.

#### General use case and requirements
1. Every user has a profile page, shows their name, address, contact information (this helps users to reach each other easily).
 User 1 needs the backyard lawn to me mowed.
User 2 has a lawn mower and would like to contribute helping their community.
2. Users can browse "Help Requests" or "Service Providers" tabs in their city only (based on the city of their profile).
3. Display posts as 25 results per page.
4. Users can change their city to a different one from a list of states/cities to browse posts from other areas.
5. Posts are ordered by date (newest first) and expire after 48 hours.
6. Users can communicate by posting comments to any post.
Optional: Design a notification system to notify post owner and commenters when any comment is posted (2 extra points added to your final course grade).
